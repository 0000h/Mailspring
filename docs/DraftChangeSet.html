<h2>Summary</h2>

<div class="markdown-from-sourecode">
  <p><p>As the user interacts with the draft, changes are accumulated in the
DraftChangeSet associated with the store proxy. The DraftChangeSet does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It debounces changes and calls Actions.saveDraft() at a reasonable interval.</li>
<li>It exposes <code>applyToModel</code>, which allows you to optimistically apply changes
to a draft object. When the proxy vends the draft, it passes it through this
function to apply uncommitted changes. This means the Draft provided by the
DraftStoreProxy will always relfect recent changes, even though they&#39;re
written to the database intermittently.</li>
</ol>
