<h3 id="do-i-have-to-use-react-">Do I have to use React?</h3>
<p>The short answer is yes, you need to use React. The <a href='componentregistry.html'>ComponentRegistry</a> expects React components, so you&#39;ll need to create them to extend the N1 interface.</p>
<p>However, if you have significant code already written in another framework, like Angular or Backbone, it&#39;s possible to attach your application to a React component. See <a href="https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact/issues/80">https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact/issues/80</a>.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-write-a-package-that-does-x-">Can I write a package that does X?</h3>
<p>If you don&#39;t find documentation for the part of N1 you want to extend, let us know! We&#39;re constantly working to enable new workflows by making more of the application extensible.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-distribute-my-package-">Can I distribute my package?</h3>
<p>Yes! We&#39;ll be sharing more information about publishing packages in the coming months. However, you can already publish and share packages by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a Github repository for your package, and publish a <code>Tag</code> to the repository matching the version number in your <code>package.json</code> file. (Ex: <code>0.1.0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make the CURL request below to the package manager server to register your package:</p>
<pre><code> curl -<span class="hljs-keyword">H</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type:application/json"</span> -X <span class="hljs-keyword">POST</span> -<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span> '{<span class="hljs-string">"repository"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;"</span>}' https:<span class="hljs-comment">//edgehill-packages.nylas.com/api/packages</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Your package will now appear when users visit the N1 settings page and search for community packages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: In the near future, we&#39;ll be formalizing the process of distributing packages, and packages you publish now may need to be resubmitted.</p>
