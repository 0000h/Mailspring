<h2>Summary</h2>

<div class="markdown-from-sourecode">
  <p><p>Images are supposed to by default show a ghost image when dragging and
dropping. Unfortunately this does not work in Electron. Since we&#39;re a
desktop app we don&#39;t want all images draggable, but we do want some (like
attachments) to be able to be dragged away with a preview image.</p>
